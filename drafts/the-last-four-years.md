Almost five years ago I started this journey of Engineering Manager.  I had so many assumptions, opinions, and honestly, doubts about what I was doing. I honestly feel like I've come a long way and still have
a long way to go.  I want to spend this time and reflect on some specific opinions and assumptions I had and how they've changed or why they've stayed the same.

## How my teams perceive me
## When things are good
## When things are bad
## Hiring
## Team building
